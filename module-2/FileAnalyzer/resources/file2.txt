Yeah
I know sometimes things may not
Always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier apenasumtesteignoraisto
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me
Hailie, I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad
Even when you smile
Even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes
Deep inside, you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared
I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying
Wipe them tears
Daddy's here
No more nightmares
We gonna pull together through it
We gon' do it
Lainie, uncle's crazy ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins
When it swirls
